# Twisters TypeScript Examples

These examples are provided to illustrate usage specific to TypeScript
(particularly using the Twisters class as a generic).

They are operationally identical to their JavaScript counterparts in [examples-js](https://github.com/adamjarret/twisters/tree/master/packages/examples-js).

TypeScript versions are not provided for all of the JavaScript examples because most
of them would not be meaningfully different.

## Usage

Scripts in the **bin** directory (excluding files in **utils**) can be run with node.

See [README](https://github.com/adamjarret/twisters#readme) in the repository root for details.
